Got it—since you want to track both real-time shop operations (via your POS) and strategic performance (via your CEO dashboard), I’ll break this into two layers:

⸻

1. POS System Metrics (Day-to-Day Operations)

These are tactical numbers your staff and managers should monitor daily to keep operations tight:

Sales & Revenue
	•	Daily/weekly/monthly sales (total revenue)
	•	Sales by category (coffee, matcha, food, add-ons, retail, etc.)
	•	Sales by product (top 10 items, slow movers)
	•	Average order value (AOV)
	•	Number of transactions (footfall proxy)
	•	Hourly sales trend (to see peak hours)
	•	Discounts & comps (track wastage & staff misuse)

Customer Insights
	•	Returning vs new customers (if loyalty system is tied in)
	•	Average spend per customer
	•	Payment method split (cash, card, digital wallets)

Inventory & Waste
	•	Real-time stock levels (milk, matcha, beans, syrups, etc.)
	•	Ingredient consumption vs sales (to catch leakages)
	•	Waste/spillage tracking

Operations & Staff
	•	Orders per staff member / cashier
	•	Staff performance (upselling add-ons, speed of service if tracked)
	•	Time to fulfill an order

2. CEO Dashboard Metrics (High-Level, Strategic View)

This is what you should be seeing weekly/monthly to make decisions on growth, profitability, and efficiency.

Financial Performance
	•	Gross sales vs net sales (after discounts/refunds)
	•	Cost of goods sold (COGS) %
	•	Gross profit margin %
	•	Labor cost % (staff wages vs sales)
	•	Operating expenses (rent, utilities, marketing)
	•	Net profit margin %

Customer & Market
	•	Customer acquisition cost (if marketing spend tied to loyalty app/ads)
	•	Customer lifetime value (CLTV)
	•	Repeat purchase rate
	•	Footfall trends (weekday vs weekend, seasonal spikes)

Product Performance
	•	Bestsellers vs underperformers
	•	Contribution margin per product (e.g., Matcha Latte profit per cup vs Cappuccino)
	•	Attach rate (how often add-ons like oat milk or croissants get sold with coffee)

Inventory & Efficiency
	•	Stock turnover (days of inventory on hand)
	•	Shrinkage (loss due to theft, spoilage, or mismanagement)
	•	Supplier performance (delays, price fluctuations)

Expansion & Growth
	•	Same-store sales growth (compare this month vs last month, vs last year)
	•	Marketing ROI (sales uplift per PKR spent on ads/promo)
	•	EBITDA trends (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization)

3. Suggested Dashboard Structure for You

To avoid data overload, I’d recommend structuring your CEO dashboard into 5 sections:
	1.	Daily Snapshot (sales, footfall, top 3 products, gross margin %)
	2.	Weekly Trends (category sales, repeat customers, staff performance)
	3.	Monthly P&L View (COGS %, labor %, operating expenses %, net margin)
	4.	Product & Menu Insights (profit per item, attach rates, stock movement)
	5.	Strategic KPIs (growth vs last month/year, CLTV, marketing ROI, expansion readiness)
